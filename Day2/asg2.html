        <h1>Difference between var, let and const</h1>
        <ol><h2>
        <li>var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.</li>
        <li>var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.</li>
        <li>They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.</li>
        <li>While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.</li>
